                Magic: the Gathering (or MTG for short) is the first ever Trading Card Game, created by Richard
                Garfield.
                It is one of the most complex games in the world, boasting over 25,000 unique cards,
                around 20 different formats both on and offline,
                and a rules book that could rival a legal code in verbosity and sheer length.
                In this game, you are a character called a planeswalker, and you are dueling an opponent planeswalker.
                You objective is to take your opponent out by either bringing them to 0 life, depleting all the cards in
                their deck,
                or a plethora of other card that result in your opponent losing the game.

                One of the main appeals to playing Magic is the hundreds of strategies that can be played.
                You can smash people with giant dinosaurs, chain groups of powerful spells,
                destroy everything your opponents build up, ammass enormous armies of goblins,
                become a powerful enchanter, summon demons to do your bidding,
                and even play with cute cats and dogs. The list goes on and on.
