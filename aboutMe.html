        <section id="information">
            <p>Hello, I am a junior in highschool (at the time of making this website)
                and created this website for my Fundementals of Web Design Class. I love to play Magic: The Gathering
                and started in 2020.
                I play Magic: The Gathering Areana for Standard and Historic gameplay and play the Commander format on
                paper.
                I have 4 commander decks built. Here is a description of each of them.
            </p>

            <div id="Hamza Deck">

                <p class="Deck Description">
                    One of them is a green/white deck with
                    <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/278/hamza-guardian-of-arashin">Hamza, Guardian of Arashin</a>
                    as the commander. It's goal is to put +1/+1 counters on several cheap creatures in order to make my
                    commander cheaper to cast.
                    Once my commander is in play, my creatures become much cheaper to cast, allowing me to play several
                    powerful creatures for a fraction of the cost. This was the first deck I ever built on paper.
                </p>

                'Creature spells you cast cost 1 less for each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it'">
            </div>
            <div id="Chatterfang Deck">
                <p class="Deck Description">
                    In my opinion, the most powerful deck I own is my <a
                        href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/151/chatterfang-squirrel-general">Chatterfang, Squirrel</a>
                    deck.
                    It is a black-green deck that aims to create a bunch of tonkens and then sacrifice them for value.
                    It is so powerful because it swarms the battlefield very quickly, interacts with my opponents well,
                    and can easily take out my opponents with cards that drain my opponents' life whenever a crature
                    I control dies. This is my favorite deck to play.
